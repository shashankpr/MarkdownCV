Career Summary
---------

Machine Learning Engineer with 2+ years of experience in building and optimizing ML models in the fields of Healthcare, Multimedia, NLP, and IoT. I have directly contributed to the Deeplearning ecosystem of my current employer. I am constantly driven by the passion for the field and have always strived towards achieving improvements in the systems, with the backing of solid research. Have a Master's Degree in CS with Data Science & Technology Specialization.

Education
---------

2016 - 2018
:   **MSc, Computer Science**: Delft University of Technology (Delft, NL)

    - *Data Science & Technology* specialization track
    - **Thesis title**: *DeepSleep: A sensor-agnostic approach towards modelling a sleep classification system*

2011 - 2015
:   **B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering**: SRM University (Chennai, IN)

    - CGPA: 8.5

Experience
----------

Oct 2017 - Present
:   **Master Thesis Student**: Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) (Amsterdam, NL)

    - **Thesis title**: *DeepSleep: A sensor-agnostic approach towards modelling a sleep classification system*
    - The research goal is to classify sleep stages, and, thereby estimate the sleep quality of a user using wearable sensor data.
    - Achieved a precision & recall score of 74% by using 1D-CNNs and bi-directional LSTMs for feature extraction and sequential learning respectively.
    - Achieved in building a universal heart-based model by using 2-phase training strategy. 
    - The work is under review for CHI 2019 conference.

Feb 2016 - Present
:   **Machine Learning Engineer**: TurtleShell Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Bengaluru, IN)

    - Machine learning pipeline for predicting and quantifying the sleep quality of an individual from ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal.
    - Achieved an improvement of 15% in the classification accuracy by using novel feature engineering. 
    - Designed explainable ML pipeline by creating visualisations of features, thus enabling shift from rule-based to ML system.


Jun 2017 - Aug 2017
:   **Machine Learning Intern**: Zoho Corporation (Chennai, IN)

    - Bayesian Optimization model on pgSQL DB to reduce bloating and downtime caused due to manual vacuuming.
    - Achieved an improvement in the reduction of DB lockdown by 40% (4-5sec per table).
    - Has been deployed into the production environment of some of the company's business products.

Projects
--------------------

HeyDobby
:   An assistant-cum-chatbot that I developed for powering my home IoT hub, Smart Mirror and for providing a real-time speech-to-text transcription. The ultimate aim is to make it aware of the surroundings and recognize the speakers, thus helping people with hearing disability to understand and communicate within a group. 
    
    - Technology stack: Python, TensorFlow, RPi, Flask, Wit.ai

Motivation Mining
:   Mining motivation trends of usage of Haskell libraries to understand the importance of library's versioning and popularity on the usage patterns of its dependencies.
    
    - My contribution was towards using NLP and logistic regression to predict the adoption of a Haskell library. 
    - Achieved results which showed that libraries with most the most community support are more popular.
    - Work has been published at 1st International Workshop on API Usage and Evolution (WAPI), 2017
    - Technology stack: Python, scikit-learn, NLTK.

Credit Fraud
:   Anomaly Detection on Adyen's credit dataset using PCA and ARIMA models
    
    - Achieved an improvement of 10% in the F1-score of the current system by using novel feature engineering and RNN.
    - Reduced computation and memory usage by 50% by using generators to handle the huge dataset.
    - Technology stack: Python, scikit-learn, statsmodel, Keras

CareFinder
:   A web search engine to search for hospitals and clinics by the type of specialist care they offer.
    
    - Worked on the illness-semantics scraper and building Knowledge graph.
    - GraphDB improved the retrieval and categorization of the illnesses.
    - Achieved an increase in retrieval speed of 10% by using knowledge graph with ElasticSearch
    - Technology stack: Python, BeautifulSoup, Neo4J, ElasticSearch

Awards & Interests
----------------------------------------

* **Regional Mathematics Olympiad (2008)**: Secured 7th rank in RMO, Gujarat region.
* **National Throwball Tournament**: Represented Gujarat state (India) in the National Throwball tournament.
* Certified PADI Open-Water Scuba Diver
* Music, especially country music and alternative rock, are my favorite. Eventually, I explore movies to discover good soundtracks, hence, a movie buff too.
* Might even give up precious nights of sleep for road trips, exciting books, live concerts, football matches, and beers.
